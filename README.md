PowerShell script to bulk-create Active Directory users from a text file with secure passwords and OU assignment.


# üë• Active Directory Bulk User Creation via PowerShell

This project demonstrates how to use PowerShell to **create multiple Active Directory users** by reading from a `.txt` file. A secure password is generated, and users are assigned to a specific Organizational Unit (OU).

## üîß What This Lab Covers

- Connect to Active Directory using `Get-Credential`
- Loop through a list of usernames in a `.txt` file
- Convert a plain text password into a secure string
- Create new AD users with properties like:
  - Name
  - UPN
  - Password
  - OU path
  - Enabled status
